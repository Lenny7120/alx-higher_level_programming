Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that involves writing tests before writing the actual code. In Python, TDD is a common and effective approach. Here's how it typically works:

    Write a Test: Before you start coding a new feature or making changes to existing code, you write a test case. This test case describes the expected behavior of the code you're about to write. You use a testing framework like unittest, pytest, or nose to create your test cases.

    For example, if you're building a function to calculate the factorial of a number, you would write a test case that specifies what the function should return for a specific input.

    Run the Test: Run the test case to confirm that it fails. Since you haven't written the code yet, the test should fail because the functionality it's testing doesn't exist.

    Write the Code: Now, you start writing the code to implement the feature or functionality you're testing. You write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.

    Re-run the Test: After writing the code, you re-run the test to see if it passes. If it does, it means your code is working as expected. If it fails, you need to modify the code until the test passes.

    Refactor (Optional): Once the test passes, you may refactor your code for clarity, efficiency, or other reasons, but you must ensure that the test continues to pass.

    Repeat: You continue this cycle of writing a test, making it pass, and possibly refactoring until you've implemented the entire feature or functionality. Each test you write verifies a specific aspect of your code.

By following TDD in Python or any other programming language, you ensure that your code is continually tested and that it meets the specified requirements. This methodology encourages small, incremental changes and helps catch issues early in the development process. Additionally, TDD results in a suite of tests that can serve as documentation and regression checks as your codebase evolves.
